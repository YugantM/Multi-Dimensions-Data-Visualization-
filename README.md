Plot multidimensional data in C/C++ IDE

IF we have dataset with multiple attributes and we want to plot it in 2D graph you can use this program to plot it.
Basic idea is x and y coordinates represent the first two attributes and at that coordinate other lines represent data with different radius and different angle.
